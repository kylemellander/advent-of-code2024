# Advent of Code 2024

## Usage

You can either run this in a browser or in the tests.

For Browser, run
`yarn dev`
and then open the browser to the hosted location. You can select the day and run it.

For tests, just run `yarn test`

## Notes

The browser setup was made using `@planningcenter/tapestry-wrap` in order to test it out.
